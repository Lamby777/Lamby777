# Hello, fellow GitHub user!

I code as a hobby, mainly in TypeScript, Rust, and Python.

Currently learning Rust, and I'm somewhat new to low-level programming languages.
I'm fairly comfortable working in TypeScript or JavaScript.
I like learning by making many small projects, or contributing new QoL fixes/features to other people's work.
Hopefully, someday, I'll work as a programmer or security researcher too.

Some of my tech-related interests:
- Video Games (and game development)
- Cybersecurity
- Hackathons / Competitions
- Linux

### Creating my own MOTHER 3 inspired RPG called P/E/T/S.
