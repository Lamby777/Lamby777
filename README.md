# Hello, fellow GitHub user!

I code mainly in TypeScript and Python, but also Rust and a little bit of Zig for my personal projects. :)
I like learning by making many small projects, or contributing new QoL fixes/features to other people's work.

Some tech-related interests:
- Video Games (and game development)
- Cybersecurity
- Hackathons / Competitions
- Linux
