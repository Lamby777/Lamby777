# Hello, fellow GitHub user!

I code as a hobby, mainly in TypeScript, Python, and Rust.

Maybe someday I'll work as a programmer, too.

Some of my tech-related interests, ranked from highest to lowest:
- Video Games (and game development)
- Cybersecurity
- Hackathons / Competitions / other challenges
- Crypto / Blockchain (I'm not a crypto-bro :> )

### Creating my own MOTHER 3 inspired RPG called P/E/T/S.
