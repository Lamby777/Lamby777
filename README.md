# Hello, fellow GitHub user!

I like learning by making many small projects, or contributing new QoL fixes/features to other people's work.
I code mainly in Rust, but also TypeScript, Python, and a little bit of Zig for my personal projects. :)

Some tech-related interests:
- Video Games (and game development)
- Cybersecurity
- Hackathons / Competitions
- Linux

Check out the [`npxTSC` organization](https://github.com/npxTSC) for some of my more serious experimental projects...
or maybe you'd rather check out [my game](https://github.com/Lamby777/PETS-G)...?
